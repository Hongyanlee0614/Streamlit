## Install

#### Open your conda's terminal and run the following:

```
$ pip install streamlit
```

#### Clone this repo using the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Hongyanlee0614/Streamlit.git
```

#### Or you can go to [this link](https://github.com/Hongyanlee0614/Streamlit) and download the zip file for entire repo

#### After that, open the clonned or unzipped Streamlit folder in your preferred editor (e.g. VS Code)


```
$ cd '.\Penguin Classification\'
```

#### Run the following command to generate the pickle file so we no need to train the model each time we change the streamlit parameter input. Note that there is a pickle file once you have clonned this repo. You can delete it at first to build from your own.

```
$ streamlit run penguins-model-building.py
```

```
```

#### Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) with your browser to see the result.
